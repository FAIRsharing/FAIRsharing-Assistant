Although descriptions of Farming Systems Research vary, the general consensus is that there are four major activities: diagnosis, planning and priority setting, experimentation and evaluation. The activities incorporated under farming systems research range from computer models simulating small-scale farm systems to integrated rural development strategies, and from complex experiment station trials of cropping systems to simple on-farm testing of technologies.

Research in bioinformatics includes method development for storage, retrieval, and analysis of the data. Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing branch of biology and is highly interdisciplinary, using techniques and concepts from informatics, statistics, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and linguistics. It has many practical applications in different areas of biology and medicine. (M. Nilges and Jens P. Linge, Unite de Bio-informatique Structurale, Institut Pasteur, Paris)",
