The ontology has been adapted from the December 2015 version of the FAO/Bioversity Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors. Reference Plant Ontologies are being developed in the context of the Planteome project and are being integrated with the Crop Ontology, which provides harmonized breeders’ trait names, measurement methods, scales and standard variables for many crops. This ontology is one of these reference plant ontologies integrated within the Crop Ontology. This ontology is currently unavailable from the Crop Ontology site, and therefore has been marked as uncertain. Please get in touch with us if you have information on this resource.",

      "description": "The Climate and Forecast Standard Names Parameter Vocabulary (CF Standard Names) is intended for use with climate and forecast data in the atmosphere, surface and ocean domains. The CF Standard Names are the list of standard names used by the CF conventions. The list includes the units recommended for each standard name (most common prefixes can be used with the units, e.g. kilo (k), hecto (h), Mega (M), etc). If a standard_name metadata attribute is associated with a data variable, its value must be chosen from the list published in the standard name table. It is not compulsory within the CF conventions to assign a standard name to a data variable, but including one helps data users to understand the contents of a netCDF file. A CF standard name is not a netCDF variable name, but instead a value for the standard_name variable attribute. A standard_name attribute identifies the physical quantity of a variable.",

The concepts of the CO are being used to curate agronomic databases and describe the data. The use of ontology terms to describe agronomic phenotypes and the accurate mapping of these descriptions into databases is important in comparative phenotypic and genotypic studies across species and gene-discovery experiments as it provides harmonized description of the data and therefore facilitates the retrieval of information.",

CONA may contain information about objects that are ceremonial or utilitarian in nature, but are not necessarily labeled as art according to traditional Western aesthetics. Architecture, destroyed works, and works depicted in visual surrogates or other works are also included. CONA also includes Getty Iconography Authority (IA) , which resides in the same editorial system as CONA. The IA includes proper names and other information for named events, themes and narratives from religion/mythology, legendary and fictional characters, themes from literature, works of literature and performing arts, and legendary and fictional places. CONA and IA are part of 5 Getty Vocabularies intended to provide terminology and other information about the objects, artists, concepts, and places important to various disciplines that specialize in art, architecture, and other material culture.",

The Crop Ontology has been created to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of Crops, on trait measurement and methods as well as on Germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms. The concepts of the CO are being used to curate agronomic databases and describe the data. The use of ontology terms to describe agronomic phenotypes and the accurate mapping of these descriptions into databases is important in comparative phenotypic and genotypic studies across species and gene-discovery experiments as it provides harmonized description of the data and therefore facilitates the retrieval of information. Although this ontology seems to have a stable status on its homepage, it is listed as Retired in AgroPortal. Therefore we have marked its record status as Uncertain.

This is an essential prerequisite for the ability to compare and contrast metabolite data across different experiments and studies. Over 200,000 names from a set of over 1,100 MS and NMR studies on the Metabolomics Workbench has been used to generate a highly curated analytical chemistry-centric list of common names for metabolite structures and isobaric species. Additionally, the vast majority of these names have been linked to a metabolite classification system using a combination of LIPID MAPS and ClassyFire classification methods. A name-conversion user interface is provided where users can submit a list of metabolite names and map them to the corresponding RefMet names. New metabolites are constantly being added to RefMet, however very new metabolite names generated by metabolomics experiments may not currently map to RefMet identifiers. Nevertheless, RefMet has the ability to greatly increase the data-sharing potential of metabolomics experiments and facilitate \"meta-analysis\" and systems biology objectives for the majority of commonly encountered metabolite species.",
