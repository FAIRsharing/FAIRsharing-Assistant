It is not possible to unambiguously interpret metadata represented as simple keywords or other non-qualified symbols. For interoperability, it must be possible to identify data that can be integrated like-with-like. This requires that the data, and the provenance descriptors of the data, should (where reasonable) use vocabularies and terminologies that are, themselves, FAIR. As such, IRIs representing the vocabularies used for (meta)data must be provided. This metric applies to part I2 of the FAIR Principles.",

Cross-references to data from a third-party’s FAIR data and metadata will naturally degrade over time, and become “stale links”. In such cases, it is important for FAIR providers to continue to provide descriptors of what the data was to assist in the continued interpretation of those third-party data. As per FAIR Principle F3, this metadata remains discoverable, even in the absence of the data, because it contains an explicit reference to the IRI of the data. This metric requires a URL to a formal metadata longevity plan. This metric applies to part A2 of the FAIR Principles.",

      "description": "Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-randomized Designs (TREND) is a 22-item checklist specifically developed to guide standardized reporting of non-randomized controlled trials. The TREND statement complements the widely adopted CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement developed for randomized controlled trials. It is intended to be used as a guide when designing evaluation studies, reporting evaluation results, and reviewing manuscripts for scientific publication. Evidence-based public health decisions are based on evaluations of intervention studies with randomized and non-randomized designs. Transparent reporting is crucial for assessing the validity and efficacy of these intervention studies, and, it facilitates synthesis of the findings for evidence-based recommendations. TREND is intended to improve the reporting standards of non-randomized evaluations of behavioral and public health intervention.",

      "description": "The Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards (PRS-RS) provides the minimal information expected of authors to promote the internal validity, transparency, and reproducibility of PRS by requiring authors to detail the study population, statistical methods, and clinical utility of a published score. PRSs, which often aggregate results from genome-wide association studies, can bridge the gap between initial discovery efforts and clinical applications for the estimation of disease risk using genetics. However, there is notable heterogeneity in the application and reporting of these risk scores, which hinders the translation of PRSs into clinical care. These guidelines update the Genetic Risk Prediction Studies (GRIPS) Statement to reflect the present state of the field. Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, data deposition is encouraged via the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the aim is to facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice.",

      "description": "To improve the sharing and reuse of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has applied the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and new community efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles.\n\nThis document presents the first version of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles), and includes explanatory text to aid adoption. It is an outcome of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG) based on community consultations that started in 2019.\n\nThe FAIR for Research Software Working Group is jointly convened as a Research Data Alliance (RDA) Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Task Force.\n\nMaintenance and Retirement Plan:\nThe FAIR4RS principles were the outcome of broad, inclusive and extensive public consultation, co-lead by members of the Research Data Alliance, Research Software Alliance and FORCE1 Any revisions or changes to the principles will require a similar process. No single institution or body has ownership over recommendations of the FAIR4RS working group.\nThe RDA Software Source Code Interest Group is the maintenance home for the principles. Concerns or queries about the principles can be raised at RDA plenary events organised by the SSC IG, where there may be opportunities for adopters to report back on progress.\nIn order to better facilitate adoption, the form of the principles will remain fixed for 2 years from the release of a 1.0 version.\nAfter 2 years, a broadly consultative and open review will be conducted to consider if the form of the principles are still appropriate and meeting the aims of the community. ReSA has agreed to lead this review effort, in collaboration with RDA  and FORCE11 members and any additional bodies relevant at that time\nIf a review finds that the principles are no longer meeting the needs of the community, the explanatory text against the reference form of the principles will be updated to indicate that the principles are being abandoned or replaced and why.",
