The data collections in HMCA primarily includes large-scale surveys of the American public about public health, attitudes towards health reform, and access to medical care; surveys of health care professionals and organizations, public health professionals, and nurses; evaluations of innovative programs for the delivery of health care, and many other topics and populations of interest. Our goal is to build a culture of health by increasing the understanding of health and health care and the factors that contribute to health in the United States through secondary analysis of RWJF-supported data collections.",
