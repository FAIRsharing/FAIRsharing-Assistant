Features include automated versioning, logging of all actions, collaboration support, free and unlimited file storage, registrations, and connections to other tools/services (ie. Dropbox, figshare, Amazon S3, Dataverse, GitHub). It is 100% free to researchers, open source, and intended for use in all domain areas. OSF has an open, public API to support broad indexing, as well as a partnership with Internet Archive for long-term preservation with a $250k preservation fund and an IMLS grant for transfer to Internet Archive (currently in progress). The OSF supports embargoing during peer review via a view-only link with the ability to anonymize contributor list. It also provides managed access by allowing access requests and private sharing settings. OSF is a non-profit with direct funder support through grants, government contracts, and community memberships.",

They are mobile genetics elements - also known as jumping genes - but only the L1-HS subfamily has retained the ability to jump autonomously in modern humans. Their mobilization in germline - but also some somatic tissues - contributes to human genetic diversity and to diseases, such as cancer. euL1db provides a curated and comprehensive summary of L1-HS insertion polymorphisms identified in healthy or pathological human samples and published in peer-reviewed journals. It will help understanding the link between L1 retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms and phenotype or disease.",
